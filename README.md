# Cyclone-SeaIce-ABS

This repository contains the core analysis scripts used to generate the main results and figures in the manuscript “Dipolar Distribution of Cyclones and Its Influence on Sea Ice Extremes in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas”.

For clarity and reproducibility, only the essential code required to reproduce the analyses is provided.
Intermediate test scripts, plotting refinements, and data preprocessing specific to local environments are not included.

The input datasets (NSIDC sea ice concentration and cyclone tracking Alogarithm) are publicly available and are described in the manuscript.
Due to data size and licensing constraints, the data themselves are not hosted in this repository.
